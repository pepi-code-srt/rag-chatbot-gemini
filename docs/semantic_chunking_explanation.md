# Semantic Chunking Explanation

Semantic chunking involves splitting text based on semantic meaning rather than fixed character counts. This preserves the context and coherence of the information, leading to better retrieval performance.

## Benefits
- Improved context preservation
- Better retrieval accuracy
- Enhanced generation quality

## Implementation
We use embedding similarity to determine split points.
